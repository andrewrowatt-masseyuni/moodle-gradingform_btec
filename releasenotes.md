####Release notes  for BTEC grading method for Moodle by Marcus Green

* Version 1.1. Marcus Green March 2016
* This is the Gloucester college release in honour of the feedback given on my visit there.
* Reduced the size of the description field as it was occupying a disproportional amount of space
* Added a check to ensure that the assignment has the BTEC scale set
* Changed CSS so the Add Criterion button lined up properly
* Changed Marking Options so it is hidden by default as it is not frequently used


###beta1 May 2014
* Changed drop down with criteria level for a text box. This was because previously it was
* limited to 6 levels, i.e. P1 to P6, M1 to M6 etc and some places have more levels than that
* Added validation on save to check for duplicate level criteria. Changed CSS to reveal the X
* that indicates you can delete a level during editing. Changed CSS for layout at marking
* time as previously the labels on the Yes No radio buttons could be mistaken for each other.
